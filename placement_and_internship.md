# What is a placement?
Placements are also known as placement years, a year in industry, an industrial placement and even sandwich placements. Many names, but they’re all one in the same. A placement is a year-long programme that takes place in between the penultimate and final year of a degree.

Candidates take a year out of their degree, and work for a company as a full-time employee for those 12 months. Then they return to university to finish their degree.

For most students, doing a placement is an optional part of their degree. In some cases, it’s a compulsory aspect of the course. The majority of students who choose to take a year out of their studies to do a placement do so to gain employability skills and get first-hand experience of a particular job role or sector.
# What is an internship?
Internships mostly take place during the summer, so you’ll often hear them described as summer internships.

They can last anywhere between four weeks to four months, and are available in almost every industry.

Employers tend to use schemes like this to unearth the best students, and find potential candidates for graduates schemes. This is one of the reasons why doing an internship increases a students’ chances of securing a graduate job.

But that’s not the only reason why students do internships – they are an opportunity to get insights into a number of different areas of the professional environment, such as:

Company culture
Using high tech software or equipment
The differences between working for a small, medium-sized or large company
Company values and vision.
# The key differences between internships and placements
There are a few key differences between internships and placements. Although both are types of undergraduate work experience, they are very different in composition.
# DURATIONThe obvious difference is duration. 
Placement students work for a company for up to 12 months, whereas internships last anywhere between four weeks and four months. A placement year is a more extensive programme, and it’s more of a commitment. In essence, you’ll be extending your degree by an extra year, so you might graduate a year later than your friends.
